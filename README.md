# mt.rainier-form

Personal project for local health clinic that wanted to use online health forms instead paper ones. Google forms was not used because of its privacy issues. This platform allows for basic user login/registration and form submission as well as admin access to these forms' data in a simple copy and paste format. This allows for significant reduction in use of paper as well as menial labor of manually inputing patients' responses into company computers.

Created using python flask and deployed on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database. Access the form here:

Designed to be filled out on IPad so formatting was not emphasized.
